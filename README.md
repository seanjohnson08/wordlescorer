# wordlescorer

## Intro
This node script runs and watches a specific bot account on Twitter (@ScoreMyWordle) and replies to anyone who asks with a score of their wordle output.

Accepting pull requests and bug reports!

## Potential future ideas
* Parse acessibility text on images that leveraged wa11y.co
* Provide a score for interesting patterns
* More compliments!
