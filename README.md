# wordlescorer

## Intro
This node script runs and watches a specific bot account on Twitter (@ScoreMyWordle) and replies to anyone who asks with a score of their wordle output.

Accepting pull requests and bug reports!

## Future ideas
* Improve parsing acessibility text on images that leveraged wa11y.co (any others parsers out there?)
* Provide a score or message for interesting patterns
* Watch @-mentions so that it works with the Wordle Twitter community (Communities are currently inaccessible via API)
* More & varied compliments!
